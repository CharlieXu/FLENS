=====

FLENS is short for _Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions_.  And
that's exactly what it is:

*A builing block for the implementation of other (higher-level) numerical
libraries or numerical applications*

This site is about a working branch that is focused on the __FLENS-LAPACK__ part
of FLENS.  In the past FLENS only had a interface/binding to __LAPACK__.  Now
we show how FLENS can be used to implement LAPACK in C++.  Of course it should
produce the same results, run at the same speed and it should be easier to
impelment a LAPACK routine with FLENS than with Fortran.

Here we show how far we got right now ...


What you should read
====================

As the documentation is almost not existing you don't have much to read.  This
is what we can offer you at the moment:

- Looking at examples is always a good start:
    - Computing a __LU factorization__,
    - computing a __QR factorization__,
    - computing __eigenvalues and eigenvectors__,
    - solving __systems of linear equations__.
- Overview of all driver functions currently implemented in __FLENS-LAPACK__

From the examples you also can see what compiler flags are needed.


Scope of this Branch
====================

- Only real matrix types with full storage and dense vector types, i.e.
    - __GeMatrix__,
    - __SyMatrix__,
    - __TrMatrix__,
    - __DenseVector__.
- Our generic BLAS implementation __CXXBLAS__.
- Support for high and multipecission types from __QD Library__ and __mpfr__.
- Support for native BLAS implementations like __ATLAS__ or __GotoBLAS__.
- Overloaded operators for BLAS mostly work but are not well tested.
  In FLENS-LAPACK we use the __FLENS-BLAS__ layer (e.g. blas::mv) which
  is for the LAPACK part often more expressive.
- We improved our *doctool* (look at the bottom of each page for *document
  source*).  We now use *restructured text*.
