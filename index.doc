FLENS is short for _Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions_.  And
that's exactly what it is:

*A builing block for the implementation of other (higher-level) numerical
libraries or numerical applications*

Some key points

- C++ library (requires a C++11 conform compiler)
- Easy install as FLENS is *headers only*
- FLENS gives you
    - Matrix/vector types for dense linear algebra
    - Generic implementation of BLAS (see __CXXBLAS__)
    - Generic reimplementation of __LAPACK__ (see __FLENS-LAPACK__)
    - Generic implementation means that you can use any element type for
      your matrices/vectors that "acts like a double".  So in particular
      types from the __QD Library__,  __mpfr__, ...
- If *high performance BLAS* libraries like __ATLAS__ or __GotoBLAS__ are
  available compile with `-DWITH_ATLAS` or `-DWITH_GOTOBLAS` respectively,
  link against them and boost performance.  FLENS does not introduce any
  overhead due to abstraction.  You get all the performance.
- __FLENS-BLAS__ is a high-level and easy-to-use __BLAS__ interface
- __FLENS-LAPACK__ is a high-level and easy-to-use C++ implementation of
  __LAPACK__.
- FLENS also allows using overloaded operators for accessing BLAS.  Most
  important in this respect:
    - Overloaded operators come without performance penalty!
    - In a special debug mode you can exactly trace what is happening and
      how you linear algebra expressions gets evaluated through BLAS
      calls
    - More features are explained in the __tutorial__.


Examples and Tutorial
=====================

- Overview of all driver functions currently implemented in __FLENS-LAPACK__
- We just started with a __tutorial__:
    - __Session 1__: General matrices and dense vectors.
    - __Session 2__: BLAS, CXXBLAS, FLENS-BLAS and Overloaded Operators.
    - __Session 3__: More on matrices: Triangular and symmetric matrices,
      matrix views, ...
    - __Session 4__: Using FLENS-LAPACK.
    - __Session 5__: Using an external LAPACK implementation.
    - __Session 6__: Sparse Matrices (_Experimental_).


Scope of this Branch
====================

- Real and complex matrix types with full storage and dense vector types, i.e.
    - __GeMatrix__,
    - __SyMatrix__,
    - __TrMatrix__,
    - __DenseVector__.
- Sparse matrices are experimental at the moment.
- Our generic BLAS implementation __CXXBLAS__.
- Support for high and multipecission types from __QD Library__ and __mpfr__.
- Support for native BLAS implementations like __ATLAS__ or __GotoBLAS__.
- __FLENS-BLAS__ and __FLENS-LAPACK__.
- Overloaded operators for BLAS working ontop of the __FLENS-BLAS__ layer.
- We improved our __DocTool__ (look at the bottom of each page for *document
  source*).  We now use *restructured text*.


Compiler Requirements
=====================
FLENS uses some of the C++11 features and therefore requires a recent C++
compiler:

  - __clang__ version 3.0 (or higher)
  - __gcc__ version 4.7 (or higher)
  - __icc__ version 12.1.2 (or higher)

  This should answer the following questions:

  - Why are the matrix/vector types in FLENS as they are?
  - Why do we reimplement the LAPACK library with FLENS?
  - What is the idea behind our CXXBLAS?

  The answer is simple:

  - LAPACK is the most advanced and best supported numerical library in the
    world.  Improvements in numerical algorithms have a great chance to make
    it soon into LAPACK.  If we keep FLENS-LAPACK up-to-date to current LAPACK
    releases we keep up with some of the most sophisticated numerical
    algorithms.
  - LAPACK gains its performance from highly optimized BLAS kernel routines.
    These implementations achieve peak performance on certain platforms.
    When possible our CXXBLAS is just an interface to these implementations.
  - For multi-precision data types CXXBLAS gives you a generic implementation
    that does not give high performance (yet) but allows using LAPACK in
    high precision.
