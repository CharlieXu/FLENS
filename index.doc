==title:The FLENS Project==

==ul:begin==
-> [FLENS] is short for Flexible Library for Efficient Numerical Solutions
-> The [FLENS] project is divided into the following modules:
--> [CXXBLAS]
--> [CXXLAPACK]
--> [FLENS]: provides matrix and vector containers.  Special features are:
---> Storage schemes that are suitable for interacting with [BLAS] and [LAPACK]
---> High level interface for [CXXBLAS] and [CXXLAPACK]
==ul:end==


==section:CXXBLAS/CXXLAPACK==

The purpose of the [CXXBLAS] and [CXXLAPACK] modules is twofold.

First, if no other BLAS/LAPACK implementation is installed on a system it
provides a reference implementation.  

Second, it provides support for linear algebra operations where elements
are user-defined types.  For instance, elements defined by the GMP library.

In the future we will extend the module such that it also serves as an interface
to [BLAS] implementations available on your system.

At the moment the [CXXLAPACK] is only on our TODO-wishlist.

==section:FLENS==

Provides matrix and vector types.  And a lot more ...
